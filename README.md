# javaproject1
This is the repository for the 1st Project in Dr. Doderer's O-O Software Dev in Java class <br/> <br/>
!!!This project utilizes two files rather than one. The first file serves as the input data set and <br/>
will be updated after each run given that tweets could be removed. The second file serves as the <br/>
output file for the set of tweets containing their predictions rather than polarity!!!
